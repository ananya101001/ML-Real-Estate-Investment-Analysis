## Objectives
- Analyze real estate market data to identify investment patterns
- Build predictive models for property valuation
- Evaluate key factors affecting real estate investment returns
- Provide actionable insights for investment decision-making

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Primary programming language
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive development environment
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: 
  - Scikit-learn
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib/Seaborn (for visualization)

## Key Features
- Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering for real estate metrics
- Multiple ML model implementations and comparisons
- Model evaluation and performance metrics
- Investment recommendations based on predictions

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/ML-Real-Estate-Investment-Analysis.git
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook ML_Midterm_Real_Estate_Investment_Analysis_Apoorva_&_Ananya_ipynb.ipynb
   ```

4. Run all cells to reproduce the analysis

## Results
The analysis provides insights into:
- Most influential features for property valuation
- Model performance comparisons
- Investment recommendations based on predictive analytics

## Future Improvements
- Incorporate time-series analysis for market trends
- Add more external data sources (economic indicators, demographics)
- Deploy model as a web application for real-time predictions
- Expand analysis to multiple geographic regions
